# CitiBike System Data Analysis

## Introduction

Citi Bike is New York Cityâ€™s bike share system established in 2013. It has become a vital part of the transportation network in New York City. It is available for use throughout the entire year. All the riders have access to thousands of bikes at hundreds of stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City. In this work, we would like to explore the characteristics of this bike share system and come up with recommendations that may improve the current program based on data analysis wtih the Citi Bike system 2019 data that is publicly available.

## Common Questions of Interests

1. What are some characteristics of the CitiBike users in NYC?
2. Are there any months that have higher usages of CitiBikes?
3. What are some features of the bike trips? Do they start and end at the same station most of the time?
